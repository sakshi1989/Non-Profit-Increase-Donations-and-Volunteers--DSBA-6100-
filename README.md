# Increase Donations and Volunteers for a Non-Profit Organization

This repository consists of the analysis of survey data. The survey was intented to determine the familiarity about the corresponding Non-Profit and the Dollar-to-Dollar Maching Program.

Additionally, I performed clustering on the North Carolina data available at [US Census Website](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table)

***Note:** the data shared by the Non-Profit is redacted, because it is their property*
